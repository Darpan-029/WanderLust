# WanderLust
Wanderlust is a dynamic, server-rendered web application inspired by Airbnb, built using Node.js, Express, and EJS templating. This project replicates core functionalities of a travel accommodation platform including create, delete and update the listingsâ€”all within a clean, responsive interface styled with vanilla CSS.
